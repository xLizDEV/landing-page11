# Interactive Resume HTML Project

## Overview
This project contains an interactive HTML resume (`Sample-Resume.html`) for XXXX YYYY, a student in the Gifted Program specializing in Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM) at Wat Nongkhaem High School. The resume features a modern UI with toggleable sections using Tailwind CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.

## File Structure
- `Sample-Resume.html`: The main HTML file containing the resume with interactive toggle buttons.
- `README.md`: This file, providing project documentation.

## Prerequisites
To view the resume, you need:
- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to open the HTML file.
- An internet connection to load the Tailwind CSS CDN (used for styling).

## Usage Instructions
1. Download or save `Sample-Resume.html` to your local machine.
2. Open the file in a web browser by double-clicking it or using a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server` for Python 3).
3. Interact with the resume by clicking the "Toggle" buttons to show or hide sections such as Education, Research Publications, etc.
4. Ensure an internet connection is available to load the Tailwind CSS CDN for proper styling.

## Resume Content
The resume includes the following sections, each with a toggle button for collapsing/expanding:
- **Header**: Name, program, school, and birth date.
- **Education**: Academic history from primary to high school (2015–2021).
- **Research Publications**: Five research projects presented at NKS (2020–2021).
- **Training & Courses**: Four technical and project-based learning courses (2019–2021).
- **Skills**: Programming (Python, C++, Java, etc.), graphics (Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator), and general software (Microsoft Office, Email).
- **Awards & Honors**: Notable achievements, including a 2021 honorable mention and a 2020 silver medal.
- **School Roles**: Leadership and sports roles (2016–Present).
- **Research Interests**: Focus areas in mathematical modeling, data mining, and sustainable entrepreneurship.

## Notes
- The resume uses Tailwind CSS via a CDN for responsive and modern styling.
- JavaScript is used for toggle functionality (`toggleSection` function) to show/hide sections.
- Replace placeholders (e.g., "XXXX YYYY", "DD MMMM YYYY") with actual details for personalization.
- The HTML file is standalone but requires an internet connection for the Tailwind CSS CDN.
- For offline use, download the Tailwind CSS library and host it locally, updating the `<script>` tag accordingly.
